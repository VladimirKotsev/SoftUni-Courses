The "C# Advanced" course builds on the skills of working with the C# language and the .NET platform, addressing more complex language-specific concepts. In the course you will learn how to create linear data structures, solve algorithmic problems (problem solving skills), work with streams, files and directories, create template classes. Attention is paid to the paradigm of functional programming, as well as to the main tool relying on it - LINQ for processing data streams.
